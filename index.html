      <h1><a id="target1"></a>What is code reviews?</h1>
      <p class="test">
        A code review — also known as a peer code review — involves one or more team members checking another teammate's
        work. This involves viewing changes made to the source code before they are implemented into the codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Code reviews are important because they improve code quality and make your codebase more stable. In addition,
        they
        help programmers build relationships and work together more effectively.

      <h2><a id="target2"></a>Tips for reviewing code</h2>
      <p>Reviewing code when you’re starting at a company can feel daunting, but it is a great way to learn more about a
        piece of code and expand your knowledge of an overall system. You might not know enough about the code you’re
        reviewing to recognize anything that could or should be changed, but there are multiple benefits to reviewing
        code, especially as a junior developer:
        <ul class="no-bullets">
          <li>💡Learning the code base</li>
          <li>🧑‍🤝‍🧑Building a feedback circle</li>
          <li>🏅Being an owner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are a few things you can do when reviewing even the most unfamiliar code:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Ask what the code is doing.</b> Take the time to understand the code and read it line-by-line. If you
            come across something you don’t understand, look it up or sift through README’s and any other documentation.
            There may be no such thing as a “bad question”, but there are lazy ones. If you still don’t understand
            something after doing your due diligence, ask the code author if she can explain the line(s).</li>
          <li><b>Ask why the code is written the way it is.</b> You might understand what is happening, but why is it
            implemented that way? Why is the variable/function named that way? Why is that a list rather than a set?
            Does it make sense? Is there a better way? Writing code requires a lot of decisions and it’s easy for the
            author to overlook small things while he’s focusing on getting the code to work. An extra set of eyes asking
            “why?” can help the author identify things they’ve missed.</li>
          <li><b>Practice good etiquette.</b> Reviewing someone’s work is a personal process, and criticism
            (constructive or not) can be difficult to digest. Help the author out by softening your request/comment,
            whether it’s a fact or opinion. A few strategies for doing this:
            <ol>
              <li>Frame suggestions as questions. “Maybe it would be better if…”, “What if this was done this way…”, “Do
                you think it might be better if…”.</li>
              <li>Keep it impersonal. Don’t say, “I think you did this wrong” or, “You could’ve done this better by…”.
                Instead, say, “I’m not sure this is correct” or, “I think this could be better”. Generally, leave out
                the word “you”.</li>
              <li>Only block a pull request if you think there will be a bug. Don’t block pull requests because of an
                opinion.</li>
              <li>Be polite. We’re all busy adults, but “please” and “thank you” still go a long way. Whether you’re
                reviewing code, or asking for a review, being appreciative for someone else’s time and effort is always
                a good idea.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2><a id="target3"></a>Pull requests & Code reviews</h2>
      <p>Code review and collaboration are at the core of pull requests. Pull requests provide you with a method for
        requesting code reviews from your colleagues and checking build status based on your most recent commit.
        Depending on your role, you may be an author, a reviewer, or both on one or more pull requests. The following is
        an illustration of how the end-to-end pull request process works.</p>

      <h2><a id="target4"></a>Commenting your code</h2>
      <p>In programming, we rarely come across problems that can only be solved in one, specific way. Your comments in
        code review result from the experience or knowledge you have gained. So when suggesting changes to the code,
        it’s usually good to write not only what you want to be corrected, but also why you think so. It is about the
        simple argumentation of your position.</p>
      <blockquote>Commenting is the “art” of describing what your code is going to do in “high level” English
        statements.</blockquote>
      <p>Well, This writing will show you how code commenting can be funny too. Here are some funny code comments
        people encountered in production code.</p>
      <p class="single-block">
        //The below code needs to be commented out.
      </p>
      <p class="single-block">
        // Yesterday I had a scare, <br>
        // I ran some code that wasn't there, <br>
        // It wasn't there again today; <br>
        // Oh, how I wish that it would stay. <br>
      </p>
      <p class="single-block">
        // This is a stupid class that I wrote under duress. I apologize to <br>// all affected. </p>
      <p class="single-block">
        return 1; # returns 1
      </p>
